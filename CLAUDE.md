# CLAUDE.md - Karpathy-Inspired Claude Code Guidelines.

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Workflow routing (read on session start)

This repo uses [`superpowers-bridge`](https://github.com/JiangWay/openspec-schemas/tree/main/superpowers-bridge) to bridge OpenSpec and Superpowers. Integration rules (language, artifact paths, PRECHECK) follow that bridge's README; this section is the routing guidance for Claude.

### Entry routing

| Trigger you observe | What to do |
|---|---|
| User starts a narrative "design discussion / let's brainstorm" | Run verbal `superpowers:brainstorming`, but **do NOT** write to `docs/superpowers/specs/`. Once the conversation converges per the 5 criteria below, promote to `/opsx:propose` |
| User invokes `/opsx:new` / `/opsx:ff` / `/opsx:propose` directly | Follow the schema's flow; artifact instructions inject at each step |
| User explicitly says bug fix / typo / config tweak / doc update | Direct PR — **do NOT** open a change (see skip rules below) |
| User is mid-change | Advance with `/opsx:continue`, `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:verify`, or `/opsx:archive` |

### When NOT to use opsx (direct PR)

| Scenario | Direct PR? |
|---|---|
| New feature / new capability / architectural change / breaking change | ❌ Use opsx |
| Bug fix (no contract change) / test backfill / linter tweak / non-breaking upgrade / typo / docs / config value tweak | ✅ Direct PR |

Principle: **process ceremony scales with risk**. External contracts / schema / cross-system integration / compliance → opsx. Otherwise → direct PR.

### Verbal brainstorm → opsx promotion criteria

All 5 must hold before promoting (any missing → keep brainstorming, **never** write to `docs/superpowers/specs/`):

1. **Scope locked** — one sentence describes what's in / out
2. **Major design forks resolved** — alternatives weighed; remaining TBDs have an owner and impact-scope statement
3. **Cross-system dependencies mapped** — ready / mockable / genuinely unknown — pick one per dep
4. **Acceptance criteria stateable** — concrete pass conditions (e.g., `./mvnw clean verify` passes + N deliverables)
5. **Conversation converging** — recent turns are confirmations, not new alternatives

When all 5 hold → proactively suggest "ready to `/opsx:propose`?" — wait for user ack. Never auto-trigger.

### Front-door anti-patterns (don't do)

- Letting brainstorming write to `docs/superpowers/specs/`
- Letting writing-plans write to `docs/superpowers/plans/`
- Promoting to opsx with unresolved blocking TBDs
- Opening a change for bug fix / typo

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **mathsnap** (2603 symbols, 2912 relationships, 15 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
